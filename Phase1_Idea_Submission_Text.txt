# ── PROJECT NAME ──
PumpIQ


# ── TAGLINE / ONE-LINER ──
AI-Powered Cryptocurrency Intelligence & Autonomous Trading Platform powered by Google Gemini


# ── PROBLEM STATEMENT ──
The cryptocurrency market has 15,000+ active tokens with new ones launching every hour. Retail investors face:
1. Information Overload: Data is scattered across 10+ platforms (CoinGecko, Twitter/X, Telegram, DEXs, news sites) with no unified view.
2. Fraud & Manipulation: Pump-and-dump schemes cause average retail losses of 60-80% on manipulated tokens.
3. Emotional Trading: Fear and greed drive impulsive decisions — the #1 cause of retail crypto losses.
4. No Affordable AI Tools: Institutional-grade analysis tools cost $500-$5,000/month, locking out everyday investors.

The core problem: Retail crypto investors have no affordable, AI-powered tool to cut through noise, detect manipulation, and make intelligent automated trading decisions.


# ── PROPOSED SOLUTION ──
PumpIQ is an end-to-end AI-powered cryptocurrency intelligence platform that uses Google Gemini (Generative AI) to aggregate real-time data from 7+ sources, analyze tokens with context-aware reasoning, and execute autonomous trades with built-in risk management.

Key Features:
- Multi-Source AI Analysis: Aggregates CoinGecko, DexScreener, crypto news, and social media (Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, Farcaster) into a single Gemini-powered intelligence layer.
- PumpIQ Score (0-100): AI-generated confidence score for every token, with natural language justification explaining WHY a token is bullish, bearish, or risky.
- Autonomous Trading Bot: AI decides BUY/SELL/HOLD with risk-adjusted position sizing, stop-loss (-8%), take-profit (+20%), and daily loss limits (10%).
- Blockchain Transparency: Every trade is recorded on Base L2 (Ethereum) smart contract for verifiable, tamper-proof audit trail.
- Conversational AI Bot: Users can ask any crypto question and get instant, context-aware responses from Gemini.
- Free & Accessible: Deployed on Vercel — zero cost for users, democratizing institutional-grade analysis.


# ── HOW GENERATIVE AI IS USED (CORE) ──
Generative AI (Google Gemini) is the CORE of PumpIQ, not an add-on. It powers:

1. Token Analysis Engine: Gemini analyzes token fundamentals + technical indicators using multi-source data fusion with structured prompt engineering.
2. Confidence Scoring: AI assigns a 0-100 confidence score with probabilistic reasoning and explains its rationale in natural language.
3. Conflict Detection: Gemini identifies contradictions between bullish and bearish signals across different data sources.
4. Natural Language Generation: AI generates human-readable verdicts, trade rationales, and market summaries.
5. Conversational Q&A: Users interact with Gemini-powered chatbot for real-time crypto questions.
6. Autonomous Trading Decisions: AI evaluates market conditions and makes BUY/SELL/HOLD decisions with risk-adjusted parameters.
7. Orchestration Layer: Multi-source data from 7 collectors is synthesized into optimized AI prompts for Gemini's context window.

Model: Google Gemini 3 Flash (gemini-3-flash-preview)
AI Modules: 8 dedicated modules (Gemini Client, GPT Fallback, Orchestrator, Confidence Scorer, Conflict Detector, NLG Engine, Conversational Bot, Trade Decision AI)


# ── TECH STACK ──
- Backend: Python 3.13, FastAPI (53 REST API endpoints)
- AI/ML: Google Gemini 3 Flash (primary), OpenAI GPT-4o (fallback)
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript Single Page Application
- Database: SQLite with JWT authentication (bcrypt)
